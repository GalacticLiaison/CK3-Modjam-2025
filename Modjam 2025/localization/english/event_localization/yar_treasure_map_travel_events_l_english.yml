 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0001.t: "Mysterious Map Fragment in Chandax"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0001.desc: "As I pace along the windswept shore, watching the tide gnaw at the earth, something catches in the rocks — a scrap of parchment, sodden and brittle with age.\n\nI pry it loose and unfold it with care.\n\nThough faded, I can still make out rough lines of land and sea, and a red ‘X’ near what seems to be an island chain.\n\nA fragment of a greater whole...\n\nand perhaps, the beginning of fortune."
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0001.a: "I'll keep it and search for other pieces"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0001.b: "This isn't worth my time"

 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0002.t: "Mysterious Map Fragment in Zadar"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0002.desc: "The remains of a splintered rowboat rest half-swallowed by sand.\n\nAmong the seaweed and broken planks, a curled piece of paper clings to a nail.\n\nI pull it free.\n\nThe ink has run in places, but there’s no mistaking it — a map, or a piece of one.\n\nAn ‘X’, a jagged coast, unfamiliar waters. I hold it tight.\n\nThe sea gives little... but today, it has given me this."

 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0002.b: "This isn't worth my time"
 
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0003.t: "Mysterious Map Fragment in Palermo"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0003.desc: "Low tide reveals many things — forgotten bones, shattered crates, and today, something rarer.\n\nA water-stained sliver of parchment wedged under a stone.\n\nI lift it gently, afraid it might disintegrate.\n\nLines emerge, crude but intentional. A symbol. A path. An 'X'.\n\nI know the look of treasure maps, and this one has the scent of buried gold and long-dead whispers."

 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0004.t: "Mysterious Map Fragment in Rhodos"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0004.desc: "The gulls circle and squawk above a drift of flotsam washed up on the rocks.\n\nAmidst the tangle of rope and driftwood, something delicate flutters — a torn page, the ink faded but legible.\n\nIt speaks not in words, but in symbols: a ragged coast, a few cryptic markings...\n\nand an ‘X’ set deep within an unnamed archipelago.\n\nA clue, perhaps. Or bait.\n\nEither way, it’s mine now."
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0004.a: "I'll keep it and search for other pieces"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0004.b: "This isn't worth my time"
 
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0005.t: "Mysterious Map Fragment in Malta"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0005.desc: "The sun has scorched the shore dry, and even the crabs seem listless.\n\nBut tucked in a bleached ribcage of some ancient wreck, I find it — a strip of old parchment, curled and cracked.\n\nA map, though not a full one.\n\nA coastline I don’t recognize, strange glyphs, and that ever-promising ‘X’.\n\nI grin despite myself.\n\nLuck, for once, has walked beside me."
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0005.a: "I'll keep it and search for other pieces"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0005.b: "This isn't worth my time"
 
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0006.t: "Mysterious Map Fragment in Tunis"
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0006.desc: "The wind tears at my cloak as I crest a dune near the surf, and that’s when I see it — a corner of paper sticking out from beneath a tangle of kelp.\n\nI retrieve it, hands trembling.\n\nThe parchment is soft with sea-rot, but the lines are clear: a few scattered islands, a winding trail, and a bold red ‘X’.\n\nThe sea keeps its secrets — but today, I’ve taken one."
 yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0006.a: "I'll keep it and search for other pieces"

#Adventure 1 - Djerba Island
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0011.t: "Arrival"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0011.desc: "The sails slacken as we near Djerba, the fabled isle off the North African coast.\n\nThe shoreline is low and strange, speckled with palms and crumbling watchtowers.\n\nMany say pirates and smugglers call this place home — fitting, if this map is worth anything.\n\nWe anchor by a shallow cove and disembark into silence and sand."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0011.a: "We'll survey the shores"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0012.t: "This might be the right bay..."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0012.desc: "Moving along the edge of the island, we find a secluded inlet shaped just like the curve drawn on the map — crescent-shaped, calm, flanked by jagged coral outcrops.\n\nIt could be nothing...\n\nor it could be the sign we’ve hunted for years."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0012.a: "Now, let's find the tower on the horizon"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0013.t: "That's the tower ..."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0013.desc: "From the dunes, I scan the land beyond the palms.\n\nA shattered stone tower leans westward above the brush.\n\nNot a fortress — just a landmark.\n\nThe same angle, the same lone shadow as sketched on the parchment.\n\nDjerba holds secrets.\n\nI feel it."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0013.a: "Let's find the cave entrance"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0014.t: "Where is this cave ?"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0014.desc: "We search beneath the tower’s slope, digging near gullies and dry gullies.\n\nNothing.\n\nNo cave, no sign.\n\nThe sand hides all.\n\nPerhaps the island has shifted since the map was drawn — or perhaps we’ve been led to dust and dreams."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0014.a: "It's time to go home"

#Adventure 2 - Bodrum
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0021.t: "Arrival"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0021.desc: "The Anatolian coast rises ahead — steep and stony, dotted with olive groves and half-ruined Byzantine watchposts.\n\nBodrum, once Halicarnassus, now lies forgotten by kings but not by my map.\n\nWe drop anchor in a small bay beneath a crescent ridge.\n\nI’ve got a feeling about this one."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0021.a: "We'll survey the shores"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0022.t: "This might be the right bay..."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0022.desc: "A trek along the shore leads us to a hollow in the cliffs — the sea has carved a perfect arc into the land.\n\nI pull the map from my coat and compare.\n\nThe shapes match.\n\nAlmost too well.\n\nThe crew says nothing, but the mood changes.\n\nThey feel it too."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0022.a: "Now, let's find the tower on the horizon"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0023.t: "That's the tower ..."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0023.desc: "I lift my eyes inland and there it is — a slender ruin perched on a rise, just as the map depicted.\n\nThe tower’s no destination, only a compass rose drawn in stone.\n\nBut it’s enough.\n\nIt confirms we’re close.\n\nCloser than ever."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0023.a: "Let's find the cave entrance"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0024.t: "Where is this cave ?"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0024.desc: "We search until our torches burn low.\n\nBehind the cliffs.\n\nBeneath the brush.\n\nStill no cave.\n\nMy hands are raw from clawing through rock and earth.\n\nThe land is right.\n\nThe signs are here.\n\nBut the treasure keeps its silence."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0024.a: "It's time to go home"

#Adventure 3 - Amalfi
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0031.t: "Arrival"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0031.desc: "The cliffs of Amalfi rise like jagged teeth from the sea, pale stone kissed by green vines and sea mist.\n\nIt’s a dangerous harbor, but the shape of the coast matches the old map well enough.\n\nWe drop anchor near a narrow inlet and ready ourselves.\n\nIf there’s truth to be found, it may be here."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0031.a: "We'll survey the shores"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0032.t: "This might be the right bay..."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0032.desc: "A narrow goat path takes us above the inlet — and there it is: a curved bay, golden sand nestled in a ring of rock.\n\nIt’s unmistakable.\n\nIt matches the parchment stroke for stroke.\n\nThe map may have faded...\n\nbut its meaning burns brighter than ever."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0032.a: "Now, let's find the tower on the horizon"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0033.t: "That's the tower ..."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0033.desc: "I turn inland and see it — a squat stone tower clinging to the ridge, half-consumed by time.\n\nIt’s where it should be.\n\nA landmark left by a hand long gone.\n\nThe map is right.\n\nAt least, so far."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0033.a: "Let's find the cave entrance"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0034.t: "Where is this cave ?"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0034.desc: "The crew combs every ravine and shadow.\n\nWe search behind waterfalls, beneath outcrops.\n\nStill — no cave.\n\nThe map has led us here, but to what? I feel the doubt returning.\n\nTreasure or mirage — I can’t yet say."

#Adventure 4 - Success - Malta
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0041.t: "Arrival"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0041.desc: "The island rises from the sea like an ancient promise.\n\nMalta — crossroad of fleets and whispers.\n\nI’ve seen this coast in dreams.\n\nAs the ship draws near, I recognize the ridge, the rock formations, even the way the land cradles the bay.\n\nThe map burns in my hand.\n\nWe’ve reached something."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0041.a: "We'll survey the shores"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0042.t: "This might be the right bay..."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0042.desc: "We slip through the surf and make landfall at a secluded cove.\n\nThe beach arcs perfectly, a silver crescent beneath the cliffs.\n\nThe map spoke true.\n\nMy heart pounds as I step ashore.\n\nThis isn't just another lead.\n\nThis is the place."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0042.a: "Now, let's find the tower on the horizon"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0043.t: "That's the tower ..."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0043.desc: "Across the ridge, the ruin stands exactly where it should — a toppled beacon, its silhouette still proud against the sky.\n\nThe same lean, the same broken edge.\n\nIt's not a marker of defense...\n\nit's a sign.\n\nThe final alignment is complete."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0043.a: "Let's find the cave entrance"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0044.t: "The cave ! The cave !"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0044.desc: "We push through overgrowth near the base of the cliff, hands raw from stone and thorns.\n\nThen, one of the crew calls out.\n\nHidden behind a curtain of twisted roots and jagged rock is a narrow opening — a cave mouth, black as pitch.\n\nThe cold air that spills out smells of wet earth and old silence.\n\nI light a torch and duck inside, heart hammering like a war drum.\n\nThe passage winds downward, each step echoing through centuries of dust.\n\nIf this is a trap, I welcome it.\n\nIf it’s nothing...\n\nI’ll break the island apart to be sure."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0044.a: "Finally"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0045.t: "Is this real ?"
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0045.desc: "The tunnel opens into a wide chamber, and the torchlight catches on something unnatural — gleam.\n\nGold, piled in heaps.\n\nGoblets, crowns, plates, coins, relics… a sea of riches long lost to time.\n\nThere are symbols on the wall, old and worn, but the treasure needs no translation.\n\nMy legs nearly give out.\n\nI walk among it, stunned, reverent.\n\nThis is what I’ve searched for.\n\nThis is what the map guarded.\n\nThe fortune that pulled me across storms, betrayal, and blood.\n\nI could laugh, cry, scream.\n\nBut instead, I reach down...\n\nand take what is finally mine."
yar_treasure_map_travel_events.0045.a: "I ... am ... speechless ..."
